# Workshop: Twitter Bot

In this workshop we build a weather app with geolocation.

> Based on Enlight's [Build a Twitter Bot](https://enlight.nyc/twitter-bot#project)

<br><br>

## Install

Copy the `.env.example` file into `.env`. The you have to set your [Twitter App credentials](https://apps.twitter.com/).

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Install project pependencies with `npm`:

```sh
npm install
```

> You need to install Node.js, the latest version should do. You can also install `nvm` for handling your node versions.

To tweet a random quote, just run:

```sh
npm run start
```

This task is defined in the `package.json` file. Check it out if you want!
